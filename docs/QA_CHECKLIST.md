# QA Checklist

Use this quick list to verify quality before shipping changes:

- [ ] Viewport meta tag is present and unique in every HTML document.
- [ ] Basic accessibility passes: images have `alt`, interactive elements are labeled.
- [ ] Layout looks correct across key breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- [ ] No duplicate IDs or missing form labels.
- [ ] Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary.
