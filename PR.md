## Summary

- Document validation steps covering redirects, static outputs, analytics consent, XSS checks, and bundle-size monitoring.
- Capture expectations for verifying blog assets and privacy safeguards before launch.

## Risks

- Validation steps may require coordination with analytics and consent tooling to reproduce reliably.
- Bundle-size measurements depend on consistent build settings; discrepancies could cause false alarms.

## Rollback

- Revert this documentation-only change by removing `docs/VALIDATION.md` and `PR.md` if no longer needed.
